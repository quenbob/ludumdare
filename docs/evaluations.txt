Nice environment setup. Player is a bit hard to control but weapon is unconventional. Would have been nice to be able to try it out in a solo skirmish!

Interesting story and dialog. Had problems with the fishing pole minigame that froze. Loved the idea of interlacing the story with minigames.

Beautiful welcome screen art. Music and sound effects are perfect for the game mood. Played a few times but didn't get very far. The slow shooting speed makes the game too hard for me :(

The music, sound effects and art create the perfect dreamy space mood for this game. Love the particles and lighting effects in the tunnel. Also liked the physics of flying the capsule that has a pulsed engine. Couldn't get past the first turret after a few tries.
